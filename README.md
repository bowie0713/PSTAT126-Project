# PSTAT126-Project
Linear Regression Project on Billionaire Dataset in R

This Project Dives into the Billionaire Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/billionaires-statistics-dataset)

We started from implementing EDA, then hypothesis testing, feature engineering, and model selections.
We then implement Lasso and Ridge Shrinkage method and Box-Cox Transformation to improve model fit and accuracy.
